This is a simple typeracer written in vanilla JavaScript*.

There are no system dependencies, you just need a JS-enabled browser. *The page scrolling functionality is implemented with jQuery scrollTop.  We're using Google-hosted jQuery, no need for a local copy.

Practice your typing skills and enlighten yourself with [the song of mehitabel](donmarquis.com/the-song-of-mehitabel).  The poem was written by Don Marquis in 1927. It is narrated by Archy, a cockroach with the soul of a poet, and tells the story of Mehitabel, an alley cat with a celebrated past.  Enjoy :)
